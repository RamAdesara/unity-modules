# unity-modules
The modules in the repository are essentially the subparts of a complete game. For example, the object pickup module contains a description of how to implement a player gameObject that can pick up items using their 'hand'. There are C# scripts included and you can understand them better by reading the comments. A complete game can be created by selecting and synthesizing the relevant modules from here and then expanding upon them.
